	<h1>Perforce/Emacs Integration</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
	  This document will help you get up and running using Emacs and
	  Perforce.
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><h2>Installing it</h2></li>
	  <p>
	    First things first - add p4.el to your .emacs file
	    <p>
	      <code>
		(load-library "p4")
	      </code>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Double check that your .cshrc file defines P4CONFIG,
	      P4USER, and P4PORT.  That's it! You should be all set to
	      use p4.el!
	    </p>
	    <li><h2>Using it</h2></li>
	    <p>
	      Once you have p4.el installed and ready to go you can
	      use emacs' built-in help to review p4.el's functions:
	      C-x p ?  will bring up the list.  C-h f p4-xyz provides
	      defun information for p4-xyz.  Each Perforce command has
	      a corresponding p4.el command.  The vc model is not
	      followed.  Use 'C-x p help commands' for Perforce help.

To diff the current file and topmost depot version, type C-x p =.

Run diff (on the client) of a client file against the corresponding
revision in the depot.	The file is only compared if the file is
opened for edit or the revision provided with the file argument is
not the same as the revision had by the client.

If no file argument is given, diff all open files.
This can be used to view pending changes.

The -f flag forces a diff for every file, regardless of whether
they are opened or if the client has the named revision.
This can be used to verify the client contents.

The -s flag outputs reduces the output of diff to the names of files
satisfying the following criteria:

	-sa	Opened files that are different than the revision
		in the depot, or missing.

	-sd	Unopened files that are missing on the client.

	-se	Unopened files that are different than the revision
		in the depot.

p4-fix is an interactive Lisp function in `p4'.

To mark jobs as being fixed by a changelist number, type C-x p X.

'p4 fix' marks each named job as being fixed by the changelist
number given with -c.  The changelist may be either pending or,
submitted and the jobs may be still be opened or already closed
 (fixed by another changelist).

If the changelist has already been submitted and the job is still

been submitted and the job is still open, the job will be marked
closed when the changelist is submitted.  If the job is already

change number is given with the -c flag the opened file is associated
with that change, otherwise it is associated with the 'default'

To create or edit a user specification, type C-x p u.

Create a new user specification or edit an existing user
specification. The specification form is put into a temporary
file and the editor (given by the environment variable $EDITOR)
is invoked.

Normally, a user specification is created automatically the
first time the user invokes any client command that can update
the depot.  The 'user' command is generally used to edit the
user's reviewing subscription list for change review.

The user specification form contains the following fields:

User:	     The user name (read only).

Email:	     The user's email address (user@client default).

Update:	     The date the specification was last modified (read only).

Access:	     The date the user last issued a client command.

FullName:    The user's real name.

Reviews:     The subscription list for change review.  You may
	     use wildcards:
		 ...		matches any characters including

		 *		matches any character except /
	     There may be any number of review lines.

The -d flag deletes the named user, but only if the user is not
the owner of any branches, clients, jobs, labels, or opened files.

The -o flag causes the named user specification to be written
to the standard output.	 The user's editor is not invoked.

To submit a pending change to the depot, type C-x p S.

Submit commits a pending change with its associated files to the depot.
With no argument submit sends the 'default' change.  With the -c flag
the designated pending change is sent.	Before committing the change
submit locks all associated files not already locked.  If any file
cannot be locked the change is aborted.	 If submit is sending the
default change it first provides the user with a dialog similar to
'p4 change' so the user can compose a change description.  In this
dialog the user is presented with the list of open files in change
'default'.  Files may be deleted from this list but they cannot be
added.	(Use an open command (open, edit, add, delete) to add
additional files to a change or to move files between changes.)

If the submit fails for any reason the files are left open in
a newly created pending change.

Submit is guaranteed to be atomic.  Either all files will be
updated in the depot as a unit or none will be.

The -i flag causes a change specification to be read from the
standard input.	 The user's editor is not invoked.

Since this uses the sendmail program, it is mandatory to set the correct
path to the sendmail program in the variable `p4-sendmail-program'.

To create or edit a job, type C-x p j.

'p4 job' creates and edits job specifications using an ASCII form.
A job is a defect, enhancement, or other unit of intended work.
The 'p4 fix' command can associate changelists with jobs.

With no arguments, 'p4 job' creates a blank job specification form
and invokes the user's editor.  When the form is saved, a job name
of the form jobNNNNNN is created.  If a jobName is given on the
command line either that named job will be created or, if the job
already exists, the job can be modified.

As jobs are entered or updated, all fields are indexed for
searching by 'p4 jobs'.  Text fields are broken into individual
alphanumeric words (punctuation and whitespace are ignored) and
each word is entered, case folded, into the word index.  Date
fields are converted to an internal representation (seconds
since 1970/01/01 00:00:00) and entered into the date index.

The fields of a job are defined by the 'p4 jobspec' command.
There is a simple default jobspec that is used if no explicit
one has been defined.

The -d flag deletes the named job and any associated fixes.

The -o flag causes the named job specification to be written
to the standard output.  The user's editor is not invoked.

The -i flag causes a job specification to be read from the
standard input.  The user's editor is not invoked.

The -f flag allows otherwise read-only fields to be set.

Integ determines what integrations are necessary between related files,
according to the branch named and its view.  These integrations, represented
by a list of revisions of branch source files which need to be merged into
the related branch target file, are scheduled for later action.	 The actual
merge and any necessary conflict resolution is performed using the resolve
command.  The -n flag displays what integrations would be necessary but does
not schedule them.  A branch name is required.

If the -r flag is present, the mappings in the branch view are reversed,
with the target files and source files exchanging place.

If no file names are given then the entire branch view is examined for
needed integrations.  Files that are not mapped in the client's view are
ignored.  Files scheduled for integration are opened for the appropriate
action in the default change.  If -c change# is given the files are opened
in the numbered pending change.

List files named or matching wild card specification.  Display shows depot
file name, revision, file type, change action and change number of the
current head revision.	If client file names are given as arguments the view
mapping is used to list the corresponding depot files.

To view a history of the change made to the current file, type
C-x p f.

List the revision history of the files named, working backwards
from the latest revision to the most recent revision 'added'.
If file is given as a client file, the depot file last gotten is
listed.	 The -l flag produces long output with the full text of the
change descriptions.

To change the type or changelist number of an opened file, type
C-x p E.

Reopen takes an already opened file and moves it to a new changelist
or changes its type (text, ltext, xtext, binary, xbinary, ktext,
kxtext, symlink, or resource).

Argument SHOW-OUTPUT  displays the *P4 Output* buffer on executing the
command if t.

		  <td>p4-edit<br>C-x p e</td>

		    <PRE>
To open the current depot file for edit, type C-x p e.

Open an existing file for edit.  The server notes that the current
user on the current client has the file opened, and then changes
the file permission from read-only to read/write.

If -c changelist# is given, the file is put into the pending
changelist; the changelist must have been previously created by
'p4 change'.  Otherwise the file is opened in the 'default'
(unnumbered) changelist.

If -t type is given the file is explicitly opened as the specified
file type.  See 'p4 help filetypes' for a complete list.  If no type
is specified, the type of the previous revision is reused.

		<tr>
		  <td>p4-describe<br>C-x p D</td>

		    <PRE>
To get a description for a change number, type C-x p D.

Display a changelist description, including the changelist number,
user, client, date of submission, textual description, list
of affected files and diffs of files updated.  Pending changelists
are flagged as 'pending' and the list of affected files and
file diffs is not displayed.

The -d&lt;flag&gt; passes a flag to the built-in diff routine to
modify the output: -dn (RCS), -dc (context), -du (unified).

The -s flag requests a shortened form of describe that doesn't
include the diffs of files updated.

Display diff of two depot files.

When visiting a depot file, type C-x p d and
enter the versions.

Example:  (find-file "/us/rv/tag/main/Construct")
	  C-x p d <RET>
	  First Version to diff: 113
	  Second Version to diff: 100

	  Will produce the diff between the two versions in the
	  output buffer *P4 Output*

Run diff (on the server) of two files in the depot.  Both files
may optionally include a revision specification; the default is
to compare the head revision.  Wildcards may be used, but they
must match between file1 and file2 and they must be escaped from
the user's shell by quoting or with backslashes ().

The -d flag allows you to pass flags to the underlying diff
program.

-dc passes the -c (context diff) flag.

-du passes the -u (unified diff) flag.

-dn passes the the -n (rcs diff) flag.

Other diff flags are not supported.

Argument VERSION1 First Version to use.
Argument VERSION2 Second Version to use.

To edit a client specification , type C-x p c.

With no argument client creates a new client view specification or
edits an existing client specification. The client name is taken
from the environment variable $P4CLIENT if set, or else from
the current host name.	The specification form is put into a
temporary file and the editor (given by the environment variable
$EDITOR) is invoked.  If a name is given, the specification of
the named client is displayed read-only.

The specification form contains the following fields:

Client:	     The client name (read only.)

Date:	     The date specification was last modified (read only.)

Description: A short description of the client (optional).

Root:	     The root directory of the client file workspace
	     (given in local file system syntax), under which all
	     client files will be placed.  If you change this, you
	     must physically relocate any files as well.

View:	     What files you want to see from the depot and how
	     they map to locations on the client.  The left hand
	     side specifies a depot path, which must begin with
	     //depot/.	The right hand side gives the corresponding
	     client path, given in canonical Perforce file syntax.
	     On expansion to an actual local client file name the
	     initial //client/ is replaced by the Root value, given
	     above.  You may use wildcards:

		 ...		matches any characters including
		 *		matches any character except /
		 %1 to %9	like *, used to associate wild cards

	     Wildcarding must be congruent in both the client and
	     depot paths.  You may have any number of view entries.
	     A new view takes effect on the next 'get'.

Normally, new clients are created with a default view that maps
all depot files onto the client.  The -t flag uses the view from
the named template client as a default instead.

The -d flag causes the named client to be deleted.

The -o flag causes the named client specification to be written
to the standard output.	 The user's editor is not invoked.

The -i flag causes a client specification to be read from the
standard input.	 The user's editor is not invoked.

Optional arguments like '-tktext' can be passed as prefix arguments.

Open a new file for adding to the depot.  If the file exists
on the client it is read to determine if it is text or binary.
If it does not exist it is assumed to be text.	The file must
either not exist in the depot, or it must be deleted at the
current head revision.	Files may be deleted and re-added arbitrarily.

If the -c flag is given the open files are associated with the
specified pending change number; otherwise the open files are
associated with the current 'default' change.

If file is already open it is moved into the specified pending
change.	 It is not permissible to reopen a file for add unless
it was already open for add.

If -t type is given the file is explicitly opened as the specified
file type, which may be text, ltext, xtext, binary, xbinary, ktext
kxtext, symlink, or resource.  Not all types are supported on all
operating systems.  See the Users' Guide for a description of file
types.	If no type is specified, the type is determined automatically
by examination of the file's contents and execution permission bits.
