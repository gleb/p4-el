To add a new version,

Add the p4.el-<version>
Add the Changelog-<version>

Then edit either the RELEASED file or the BETA file, depending on what the
stability of this version is,

Add the number to the top of that file on a separate line.
Delete the oldest version number.
Save the file.

Now delete the corresponding p4.el and Changelog files for the version that
you just deleted.

The new ones should show up on the web page.
